There appears to be an increasing relationship between mass killing incidents and the year. We can also notice that there is greater variability in the number of mass killing incidents as year increases. From this information one could say there is an approximate increasing relationship but not necessarily linear.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(kill_df$year, kill_df$popn, main = "US Population Growth between 1982 ~ 2018", xlab = "Year", y = "Population (100M)")
```
There is a clear linear positive linear relationship between the population of the US and the year. As year increases, population increases at a linear rate.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(kill_df$year, kill_df$masskill/kill_df$popn)
```
This graph of the proportion of mass killings per 100 million population looks pretty much exactly the same as the mass killing incidents per year graph. There is an increasing relationship between the proportion of kills/100M population and the year, while variance in the proportion increases as year increases.
